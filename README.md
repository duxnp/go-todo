# Todos

Go + Echo + Templ + HTMX + Tailwind CSS

I guess there will be some pages for adding and deleting Todos, but this is mostly a bunch of tests to learn how to make a web app with Go.

## Getting Started

I'm not sure what to put here yet. All I can say is this was originally generated with [Go Blueprint](https://github.com/Melkeydev/go-blueprint)

## MakeFile

run all make commands with clean tests

```bash
make all build
```

build the application

```bash
make build
```

run the application

```bash
make run
```

Create DB container

```bash
make docker-run
```

Shutdown DB container

```bash
make docker-down
```

live reload the application

```bash
make watch
```

run the test suite

```bash
make test
```

clean up binary from the last build

```bash
make clean
```
